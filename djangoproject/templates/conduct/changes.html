We're (mostly) programmers, so we'll track changes to the code of conduct and
associated documents the same way we track changes to code. All changes will
proposed via a pull request to the
<a href="https://github.com/django/djangoproject.com">djangoproject.com repository
on GitHub</a>. Changes will be reviewed by the conduct committee first, and then
sent to the DSF, the Django core team, and the Django community for comment.
We'll hold a comment period of at least one week,  and then each group will vote
on the change using its normal process (a board for the DSF,
<a href="{{ dev_bugs_features_url }}#how-we-make-decisions">
a core dev vote</a> for the core team).
Approved changes will be merged, published, and noted below.{% endblocktranslate %}</p>

<p>{% blocktranslate trimmed %}This only applies to material changes; changes that don't effect the intent
(typo fixes, re-wordings, etc.) can be made immediately.{% endblocktranslate %}</p>

<p>{% blocktranslate trimmed %}A complete list of changes can always be found
<a href="https://github.com/django/djangoproject.com/commits/main/templates/conduct">on GitHub</a>;
major changes and releases are summarized below.{% endblocktranslate %}</p>
