  <p>
    {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
      We're (mostly) programmers, so we'll track changes to the code of conduct and
      associated documents the same way we track changes to code. All changes will
      be proposed via a pull request to the
      <a href="https://github.com/django/djangoproject.com">djangoproject.com repository
        on GitHub</a>. Changes will be reviewed by the conduct committee first, and then
      sent to the DSF and the Django community for comment.
      We'll hold a comment period of at least one week, then the DSF board will vote on
      the change. Approved changes will be merged, published, and noted below.{% endblocktranslate %}</p>

      This only applies to material changes; changes that don't affect the intent
      (typo fixes, re-wordings, etc.) can be made immediately{% endblocktranslate %}</p>
