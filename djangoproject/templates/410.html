<h2>Page removed.</h2>

<p>Sorry, we've removed some of parts of the site that were completely out
of date. In most cases, that content has been moved into
<a href="{% url 'homepage' host 'docs' %}">the new documentation site</a>.</p>

<p>Here's a link to the <a href="{% url 'homepage' %}">homepage</a>. You know, just in case.</p>
