Hi {{ name }},

{% blocktranslate trimmed %}
This is to let you know that payment for your recurring donation to the Django Software Foundation has failed.
This might be because your payment card has expired.

{% url 'fundraising:manage-donations' donation.donor.pk as manage_url %}
{% blocktranslate trimmed %}
Please go to {{ manage_url }} to add a new card. We won't be able to take any payments in the mean time.
{% endblocktranslate %}

{% translate "Thanks very much for your support." %}

Regards,
Django Software Foundation
