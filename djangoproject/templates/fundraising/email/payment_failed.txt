Hi {{ name }},

This is to let you know that payment for your recurring donation to the Django Software Foundation has failed.
This might be because your payment card has expired or you don't have enough funds.

Please check your bank balance or go to {{ manage_url }} to add a new card. We will try to take payment again in 3 days.

Thanks very much for your support.

Regards,
Django Software Foundation
