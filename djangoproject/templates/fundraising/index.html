<h1>About the program</h1>
<p>Django Fellowship is a project where paid contractors are engaged to manage
  some of the administrative and community management tasks of the Django
  project to support rapid development of Django itself. The first three months
  of the pilot project proved to be very successful, but <b>we need your
  help</b> to keep it going.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When I started contributing to Django, patches - especially non-trivial ones -
  had a tendency to languish in the pull request queue. I eventually gave up on
  contributing altogether after some of my contributions remained unreviewed for
  months. Then Tim started dedicating a lot of time to Django and reviewed my
  contributions. The timely reviews and fast feedback loop acted as catalyst and
  together we've landed over a hundred patches including 4 major features for
  Django 1.7 in a matter of months. The churn rate on Django contributors has
  been very high historically and the Fellowship program is a direct answer to
  that; it's a great chance for Django and for everyone who relies on it.</p>
  <em>Loïc Bistuer, Django Core Developer</em>
</blockquote>

<p>The weekly cost of the program is about $2,800. We're try to raise an initial
   $XXX to renew the program, after which we'll endeavor to raise funds on a
   weekly basis to sustain the program.</p>

        <h2>What is the Django Fellowship program?</h2>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2014/sep/18/dsf-calls-applicants-django-fellow/">
        Django Fellowship program</a> is a project where paid contractors are
        engaged to manage some of the administrative and community management
        tasks of Django project. The initial pilot took three months and closed
        in mid-January. One of the major goals is to secure funding for this
        program on an ongoing basis.</p>
        <p>The first three months of the Django Fellowship program have been
        very successful. In this short time, two Django Fellows, one full-time
        and one part-time, worked on around 240 pull requests (including
        reviewing some of the major features that will be in Django 1.8),
        triaged at least 90 different tickets and made around 200 commits in
        total!</p>
        <p>We believe the program has already had a great positive impact on
        how Django is developed and maintained. Release blocking and severe
        bugs are not postponed indefinitely. Django Fellows are a resource to
        help review patches and contributions from the community.</p>
        <p>The Django Fellowship program costs around $10K each month to
        maintain.</p>

        <h2>Who were the Django Fellows?</h2>
        <p>The two fellows for the duration of the pilot were:</p>
        {# here we need Tim's and Berker's photos! #}
        <p><b>Tim Graham</b> - a member of the core team for several years. For
        the 12 months before the fellowship began, he was a major contributor,
        reviewing and merging pull requests. Tim was contracted as a full-time
        Fellow for the duration of the 3 month pilot.</p>
        <p><b>Berker Peksağ</b> - a core developer on CPython, Gunicorn, and
        Hylang. In the Django community, he had submitted a few patches, as
        well as organized a Django sprint in Istanbul. During the 3 month pilot,
        Berker supported Tim part-time.</p>
        <p>If the program is renewed, there will be a new application period
        for the next fellow(s).</p>
