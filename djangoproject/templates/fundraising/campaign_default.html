<h1>About the program</h1>
<p>Django Fellowship is a project where paid contractors are engaged to manage
  some of the administrative and community management tasks of the Django
  project to support rapid development of Django itself. </p>

<p><strong>The first three months of the Django Fellowship program have been very successful.</strong>
  In this short time, <a href="#about">two Django Fellows</a>, one full-time and one part-time, worked on
  around 240 pull requests (including reviewing some of the major features that will
  be in <a href="/weblog/2015/jan/16/django-18-alpha-1-released/">Django 1.8</a>), triaged at
  least 90 different tickets, and made around 200 commits in total! You can read
  <a href="/weblog/2015/jan/21/django-fellowship-retrospective/">the retrospective
  on the things that have been accomplished</a> on our blog.</p>

<h1>We need your help!</h1>

<p>The program has already had a major positive impact on how Django is developed
   and maintained. Release blocking and severe bugs are not postponed indefinitely. Django
   Fellows are a resource to help review patches and contributions from the community, and
   the community loves that:</p>

<p><strong>If you use Django on a daily basis and care about the development of Django
   itself, you should donate today</strong> (may be <a href="/foundation/donate/#tax-deductible">tax deductible</a>).
   Only with your support can we make sure that the Web framework you base your work on
   can grow to be even better in the coming years.</p>

<p>The weekly cost of the program is about US&nbsp;$2,800.00. <strong>We're
   trying to raise an initial US&nbsp;${{ campaign.goal|intcomma }} to renew the program
   for at least three months, after which we'll endeavor to raise funds on a
   weekly basis to sustain the program.</strong></p>

        <h2>What is the Django Software Foundation?</h2>
        <p>Development of Django is supported by an independent foundation
          established as a 501(c)(3) non-profit. Like most open-source foundations,
          the goal of the <a href="/foundation/">Django Software Foundation</a>
          is to promote, support, and advance the Django Web framework. If you're
          interested in how the Django Software Foundation supports the Django
          Web framework, we published a
          <a href="/weblog/2015/jan/08/django-software-foundation-2014/">Summary
          of 2014. </a>
        </p>

        <h2>Who were the Django Fellows?</h2>
        <p>The two Fellows for the duration of the pilot were:</p>
        <p><strong>Tim Graham</strong> - a member of the core team for several years. For
        the 12 months before the fellowship began, he was a major contributor,
        reviewing and merging pull requests. Tim was contracted as a full-time
        Fellow for the duration of the 3 month pilot.</p>
        <p><strong>Berker PeksaÄŸ</strong> - a core developer on CPython, Gunicorn, and
        Hylang. In the Django community, he had submitted a few patches, as
        well as organized a Django sprint in Istanbul. During the 3 month pilot,
        Berker supported Tim part-time.</p>
        <p>If the program is renewed, there will be a new application period
        for the next fellow(s).</p>
