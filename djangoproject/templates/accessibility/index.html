  <h1>{% translate "Django Accessibility Statement" %}</h1>

  <p>
    {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
      The Django Software Foundation is committed to fostering an inclusive and
      accessible community, project, and ecosystem. Accessibility is integral to
      creating a space where everyone — regardless of ability — can contribute,
      build, and benefit from the Django framework and its broader community.

  <h2>{% translate "Our commitment" %} <a class="plink" href="#our-commitment">¶</a></h2>

  <p>
    {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
      We strive to make Django itself and its related online and in-person spaces
      accessible for all. This includes:
    {% endblocktranslate %}
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>{% translate "Supporting the creation of accessible web applications with Django." %}</li>
    <li>
      {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
        Ensuring that our documentation, community tools, and websites are navigable and usable for
        people with disabilities.
      {% endblocktranslate %}</li>
    <li>
      {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
        Encouraging accessibility awareness across all aspects of the project, from events and
        communication to software design and development.
      {% endblocktranslate %}</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>{% translate "Accessibility in the Django web framework" %} <a class="plink" href="#accessibility-in-the-django-web-framework">¶</a></h3>

  <p>
    {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
      We aim for conformance with recognized standards such as the
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">
        Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a>
      (WCAG) and the
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/atag/">
        Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines</a>
      (ATAG). Where feasible, we strive to exceed these standards. Through documentation, tutorials,
      and exemplar implementation, we highlight best practices for building accessible applications.
    {% endblocktranslate %}
  </p>

  <p>
    {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
      We also encourage feedback and contributions to improve accessibility features in Django’s admin interface and related tools such as Django forms, particularly from people with disabilities or other accessibility needs.
    {% endblocktranslate %}

  <h3>{% translate "Community and events" %} <a class="plink" href="#community-and-events">¶</a></h3>

  <p>
    {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
      The Django Software Foundation is committed to ensuring that events receiving our grant funding
      are accessible to all. We encourage organizers to choose venues and platforms that meet physical
      accessibility needs, that provide resources such as captioning and sign language interpretation
      where possible. We welcome feedback to make improvements on any and all aspects of physical
      accessibility.
    {% endblocktranslate %}

  <h3>{% translate "Known issues and continuous improvement" %} <a class="plink" href="#known-issues-and-continuous-improvement">¶</a></h3>

  <p>
    {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
      We acknowledge that there is always room to improve. Accessibility is an ongoing process, and
      we aim to address issues as they arise. Known accessibility issues with the Django framework,
      admin interface, or community platforms are tracked publicly, and we welcome collaboration to
      resolve them.
