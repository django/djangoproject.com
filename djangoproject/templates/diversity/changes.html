  <h1>Django Community Diversity Statement - Changes</h1>

  <h2>Change control process</h2>

  <p>We're (mostly) programmers, so we'll track changes to the diversity statement
    the same way we track changes to code. All changes will proposed via a pull request
    to the
    <a href="https://github.com/django/djangoproject.com">djangoproject.com repository
      on GitHub</a>. Changes will be reviewed by the membership first, and then
    sent to the DSF and the Django community for comment.
    We'll hold a comment period of at least one week, then the DSF board will vote on
    the change. Approved changes will be merged, published, and noted below.</p>

  <p>This only applies to material changes; changes that don't effect the intent
    (typo fixes, re-wordings, etc.) can be made immediately.</p>

  <p>A complete list of changes can always be found
    <a href="https://github.com/django/djangoproject.com/commits/main/djangoproject/templates/diversity">on GitHub</a>;
    major changes and releases are summarized below.</p>
