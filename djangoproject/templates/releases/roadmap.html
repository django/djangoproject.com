  <h1>Django {{ series }} Roadmap</h1>
  <p>This document details the schedule and roadmap towards Django {{ series }}.</p>

  <section id="what-features-will-be-released">
    <h2>What features will be in Django {{ series }}?</h2>
    <p>Whatever gets committed by the alpha feature freeze!</p>
    <p>Django {{ series }} will be a time-based release. Any features completed and committed
      to main by the alpha feature freeze deadline noted below will be included. Any
      that miss the deadline won't.</p>
    <p>If you have a major feature you'd like to contribute, please introduce yourself
      on the <a href="https://forum.djangoproject.com/c/internals/5">django-internals forum</a>
      so you can find a shepherd for your feature.</p>
    <p>Minor features and bug fixes will be merged as they are completed. If you
      have submitted a patch, ensure the flags on the Trac ticket are correct so it
      appears in the "Patches needing review" filter of the
      <a href="https://dashboard.djangoproject.com/">Django Development Dashboard</a>.
      Better yet, find someone to review your patch and mark the ticket as
      "Ready for checkin". Tickets marked "Ready for checkin" are regularly reviewed
      by mergers.</p>

  <section id="schedule">
    <h2>Schedule</h2>
    <p>
      Major milestones along the way to {{ series }} are scheduled below.

    <section id="process">
      <h3>Process</h3>
      <p>Any features not completed by the feature freeze date won't make it into {{ series }}.</p>
      <p>The release manager will keep the schedule updated and ensure efficient
        routing of issues and reminders for deadlines.</p>

      <section id="feature-freeze-alpha-1">
        <h4>Feature freeze / Alpha 1</h3>
        <p>All major and minor features must be merged by the Alpha 1 deadline. Any
          features not done by this point will be deferred or dropped. At this time, we
          will fork <code>stable/{{ series }}.x</code> from <code>main</code>.</p>
        <p>After the alpha, non-release blocking bug fixes may be backported at the
          mergers' discretion.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="beta-1">
        <h4>Beta 1</h3>
        <p>Beta 1 marks the end of changes that aren't release blocking bugs. Only release
          blocking bug fixes will be allowed to be backported after the beta.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="rc-1">
        <h4>RC 1</h3>
        <p>If release blockers are still coming in at the planned release candidate date,
          we'll release beta 2 to encourage further testing. RC 1 marks the freeze for
          translation strings; translators will have two weeks to submit updates. Release
          blocking bug fixes may continue to be backported.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="final">
        <h4>Final</h3>
        <p>Django {{ series }} final will ideally ship two weeks after the last RC. If no major bugs
          are found by then, {{ series }} final will be issued; otherwise, the timeline will be
          adjusted as needed.</p>
