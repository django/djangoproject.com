  <h2>{% translate "Teams" %}</h2>
  <p>
    {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
      The following teams are groups of people who support the Django project
      and the Django Software Foundation. Apart from the Django Fellows, who
      are paid contractors, all of these contributors are volunteers.
      Most teams are distinct, contactable groups with their own set of goals.
      Some roles are also listed, such as Mergers and Releasers, which are
      individuals with elevated permissions rather than formal teams. For an
      overview of how the Django Project is organized and the principles that
      guide it, see the
      <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/organization/#organization-of-the-django-project">
        organization and principles
      </a> page.
