      Individual Members are appointed by the DSF in recognition of their service to the Django community.

      Service to the Django community takes many forms. Here are some non-exhaustive examples of the categories of work that might qualify as service:

      <ul>
        <li>Code contributions on Django projects or major third-party packages in the Django ecosystem</li>
        <li>Reviewing pull requests or triaging Django project tickets</li>
        <li>Documentation, tutorials or blog posts related to Django</li>
        <li>Discussions about Django in community areas such as the django-developers mailing list and Django Forum</li>
        <li>Attending or organizing Django-related events or user groups</li>
      </ul>
