Hello {{ name }},

We're updating the Django Individual Members list so each member's name can link to their djangoproject.com profile. On your profile, you can share a short bio, highlight your contributions to Django or the community, and provide ways for others to get in touch.

To have your name linked, please create an account (if you don't already have one) at:

{% url 'registration_register' %}

Note: If you log in to Trac with your GitHub account, your djangoproject.com username should match your GitHub username for certain stats to appear on your profile.

Once your account is ready, let us know your username so we can connect it to the members list.

This small step helps the community grow more connected and makes it easier for everyone to explore and engage with it.

Thank you for being part of the Django community.

Django Software Foundation
