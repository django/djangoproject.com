<p>The Django Project is managed by a team of volunteers pursuing three goals:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Driving the development of the Django web framework,</li>
<li>Fostering the ecosystem of Django-related software,</li>
<li>Leading the Django community in accordance with the values described in the
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/">Django Code of Conduct</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Django Project isn’t a legal entity. The <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/">Django Software Foundation</a>, a
non-profit organization, handles financial and legal matters related to the
Django Project. Other than that, the Django Software Foundation lets the
Django Project manage the development of the Django framework, its ecosystem
and its community.</p>

<p>Mergers hold the following prerogatives:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Merging any pull request which constitutes a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/django/deps/blob/main/accepted/0010-new-governance.rst#terminology">minor change</a> (small enough
not to require the use of the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/django/deps/blob/main/final/0001-dep-process.rst">DEP process</a>). A Merger must not merge a
change primarily authored by that Merger, unless the pull request has been
approved by:<ul>
<li>another Merger,</li>
<li>a steering council member,</li>
<li>a member of the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/teams/#triage-review-team">triage &amp; review team</a>, or</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Initiating discussion of a minor change in the appropriate venue, and request
that other Mergers refrain from merging it while discussion proceeds.</li>
<li>Requesting a vote of the steering council regarding any minor change if, in
the Merger’s opinion, discussion has failed to reach a consensus.</li>
<li>Requesting a vote of the steering council when a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/django/deps/blob/main/accepted/0010-new-governance.rst#terminology">major change</a> (significant
enough to require the use of the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/django/deps/blob/main/final/0001-dep-process.rst">DEP process</a>) reaches one of its

<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/teams/#steering-council-team">The steering council</a> selects <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/teams/#mergers-team">Mergers</a> as necessary to maintain their number
at a minimum of three, in order to spread the workload and avoid over-burdening
or burning out any individual Merger. There is no upper limit to the number of
Mergers.</p>
<p>It’s not a requirement that a Merger is also a Django Fellow, but the Django
Software Foundation has the power to use funding of Fellow positions as a way
to make the role of Merger sustainable.</p>
<p>The following restrictions apply to the role of Merger:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A person must not simultaneously serve as a member of the steering council. If
a Merger is elected to the steering council, they shall cease to be a Merger
immediately upon taking up membership in the steering council.</li>
<li>A person may serve in the roles of Releaser and Merger simultaneously.</li>
</ul>
<p>The selection process, when a vacancy occurs or when the steering council deems
it necessary to select additional persons for such a role, occur as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Any member in good standing of an appropriate discussion venue, or the Django
Software Foundation board acting with the input of the DSF’s Fellowship
committee, may suggest a person for consideration.</li>
<li>The steering council considers the suggestions put forth, and then any member
of the steering council formally nominates a candidate for the role.</li>
<li>The steering council votes on nominees.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mergers may resign their role at any time, but should endeavor to provide some
advance notice in order to allow the selection of a replacement. Termination of
the contract of a Django Fellow by the Django Software Foundation temporarily
suspends that person’s Merger role until such time as the steering council can
vote on their nomination.</p>
<p>Otherwise, a Merger may be removed by:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Becoming disqualified due to election to the steering council.</li>
<li>Becoming disqualified due to actions taken by the Code of Conduct committee
of the Django Software Foundation.</li>
<li>A vote of the steering council.</li>

<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/teams/#steering-council-team">The steering council</a> is an elected group of five experienced contributors
who demonstrate:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A history of substantive contributions to Django or the Django ecosystem.
This history must begin at least 18 months prior to the individual’s
candidacy for the Steering Council, and include substantive contributions in
at least two of these bullet points:
- Code contributions on Django projects or major third-party packages in the Django ecosystem
- Reviewing pull requests and/or triaging Django project tickets
- Documentation, tutorials or blog posts
- Discussions about Django on the django-developers mailing list or the Django Forum
- Running Django-related events or user groups</li>
<li>A history of engagement with the direction and future of Django. This does
not need to be recent, but candidates who have not engaged in the past three
years must still demonstrate an understanding of Django’s changes and
direction within those three years.</li>
</ul>
<p>A new council is elected after each release cycle of Django. The election process
works as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The steering council directs one of its members to notify the Secretary of the
Django Software Foundation, in writing, of the triggering of the election,
and the condition which triggered it. The Secretary post to the appropriate
venue – the <a class="reference internal" href="mailing-lists.html#django-developers-mailing-list"><span class="std std-ref">django-developers</span></a> mailing list and the <a class="reference external" href="https://forum.djangoproject.com/">Django forum</a> to
announce the election and its timeline.</li>
<li>As soon as the election is announced, the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/#board">DSF Board</a> begin a period of
voter registration. All <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/individual-members/">individual members of the DSF</a> are automatically
registered and need not explicitly register. All other persons who believe
themselves eligible to vote, but who have not yet registered to vote, may
make an application to the DSF Board for voting privileges. The voter
registration form and roll of voters is maintained by the DSF Board. The DSF
Board may challenge and reject the registration of voters it believes are
registering in bad faith or who it believes have falsified their
qualifications or are otherwise unqualified.</li>
<li>Registration of voters close one week after the announcement of the
election. At that point, registration of candidates begin. Any qualified
person may register as a candidate. The candidate registration form and
roster of candidates are maintained by the DSF Board, and candidates must
provide evidence of their qualifications as part of registration. The DSF
Board may challenge and reject the registration of candidates it believes do
not meet the qualifications of members of the Steering Council, or who it
believes are registering in bad faith.</li>
<li>Registration of candidates close one week after it has opened. One week
after registration of candidates closes, the Secretary of the DSF publish
the roster of candidates to the <a class="reference internal" href="mailing-lists.html#django-developers-mailing-list"><span class="std std-ref">django-developers</span></a> mailing list and the
<a class="reference external" href="https://forum.djangoproject.com/">Django forum</a>, and the election begin. The DSF Board provide a voting form
accessible to registered voters, and is the custodian of the votes.</li>
<li>Voting is by secret ballot containing the roster of candidates, and any
relevant materials regarding the candidates, in a randomized order. Each
voter may vote for up to five candidates on the ballot.</li>
<li>The election conclude one week after it begins. The DSF Board then tally the
votes and produce a summary, including the total number of votes cast and
the number received by each candidate. This summary is ratified by a
majority vote of the DSF Board, then posted by the Secretary of the DSF to
the <a class="reference internal" href="mailing-lists.html#django-developers-mailing-list"><span class="std std-ref">django-developers</span></a> mailing list and the Django Forum. The five
candidates with the highest vote totals are immediately become the new
steering council.</li>
</ol>
<p>A member of the steering council may be removed by:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Becoming disqualified due to actions taken by the Code of Conduct committee
of the Django Software Foundation.</li>
<li>Determining that they did not possess the qualifications of a member of the
steering council. This determination must be made jointly by the other members
of the steering council, and the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/#board">DSF Board</a>. A valid determination of
ineligibility requires that all other members of the steering council and all
members of the DSF Board vote who can vote on the issue (the affected person,
if a DSF Board member, must not vote) vote “yes” on a motion that the person
in question is ineligible.</li>
