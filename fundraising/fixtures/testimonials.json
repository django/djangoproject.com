I eventually gave up on contributing altogether after some of my contributions remained unreviewed for months. Then Tim started dedicating a lot of time to Django and reviewed my contributions. The timely reviews and fast feedback loop acted as catalyst and together we've landed over a hundred patches including 4 major features for Django 1.7 in a matter of months. The churn rate on Django contributors has been very high historically and the Fellowship program is a direct answer to that; it's a great chance for Django and for everyone who relies on it.",

By contributing to Django, I learned, through Tim's timely and complete reviews of my contributions, that programming is more than just code -- it is the systematic approach to design, code, review, documentation, and testing of software. I am indebted to Tim and the Django Software Foundation's fellowship program for this.",
