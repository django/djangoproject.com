"An imposed vacation (i.e. asking someone to \"take a week off\" from the "

msgid "Why have you adopted a Code of Conduct?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We think the Django community is awesome. If you're familiar with the Django "
"community, you'll probably notice that the Code basically matches what we "
"already do. Think of this as documentation: we're taking implicit "
"expectations about behavior and making them explicit."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We're doing this because the Django community is growing faster than any of "
"us could have anticipated. This is on balance a very positive thing, but as "
"we've grown past the point where it's possible to know the whole community "
"we think it's very important to be clear about our values."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We know that the Django community is open, friendly, and welcoming. We want "
"to make sure everyone else knows it too."
msgstr ""

msgid "What does it mean to \"adopt\" a Code of Conduct?\" "
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For the most part, we don't think it means large changes. We think that the "
"text does a really good job describing the way the Django community already "
"conducts itself. We expect that most people will simply continue to behave "
"in the awesome way they have for years."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, we do expect that people will abide by the spirit and words of the "
"CoC when in \"official\" Django spaces. This code has been adopted by both "
"the Django core team and by the Django Software Foundation. That means that "
"it'll apply both in community spaces <em>and</em> at DSF events."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In practice, this means the Django forum, bug tracking and code review "
"tools, and \"official\" Django events such as DjangoCons. In addition, "
"violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a person's ability "
"to participate within them."
msgstr ""

#, python-format

"This Code of Conduct also covers any events that the DSF funds. However, "

msgstr ""

msgid "No: there's a difference between the two, and they're complementary."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This Code of Conduct is all about how we interact as a community. It's about "
"saying that the Django community will be open, friendly, and welcoming. The "
"core issue is about ensuring the conversations we have are productive and "
"inviting for all."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Real-life events, however, require a bit more care. The DSF wants to be sure "
"that any events it funds have policies and procedures in place for handling "
"harassment. It's especially important to us that real-life events take steps "
"to protect the physical and mental security of their participants."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"So the DSF will require that any events it funds have some sort of anti- "
"harassment policy in place. The DSF thinks the <a href=\"http://"

"However, even if everyone was kind, everyone was compassionate, and everyone "

"diversity awareness is not a very common topic. When we approached different "
"local companies about our workshops they usually didn't get what we were "
"actually doing and why it is important. If not for the DSF, we probably "
"would not have been able to hold our workshops at all. Our first workshops "
"were the only until now workshops that were 100%% female - female only "
