<h1>Django Code of Conduct - Enforcement Manual</h1>

<h2 class="deck">This is the enforcement manual followed by Django's Code of
Conduct Working Group. It's used when we respond to an issue to make sure we're
consistent and fair. It should be considered an internal document, but we're
publishing it publicly in the interests of transparency.<h2>

<h3>The Conduct Working Group</h3>

<p>All responses to reports of conduct violations will be managed by a Code of
Conduct Working Group ("the working group").</p>

<p>The Django Software Foundation's Board of Directors ("the board") will establish
this working group, compromised of at least three members. One member will be
designated chair of the group and will be responsible for all reports back to
the board. The board will review membership on a regular basis.</p>

<h3>How the working group will respond to reports</h3>

<p>When a report is sent to the working group they will immediately reply to the
report to confirm receipt. This reply must be sent within 24 hours, and the
group should strive to respond much quicker than that.</p>

<p>See the <a href="/conduct/reporting/">reporting guidelines</a> for details of
what reports should contain. If a report doesn't contain enough information, the
working group will obtain all relevant data before acting. The working group is
empowered to act on the DSF's behalf in contacting any individuals involved to
get a more complete account of events.</p>

<p>The working group will then review the incident and determine, to the best of their ability:
<ul>
    <li>what happened</li>
    <li>whether this event constitutes a code of conduct violation</li>
    <li>who, if anyone, was the bad actor</li>
    <li>whether this is an ongoing situation, and there is a threat to anyone's physical safety</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>This information will be collected in writing, and whenever possible the
group's deliberations will be recorded and retained (i.e. IRC transcripts, email
discussions, recorded voice conversations, etc).</p>

<p>The working group should aim to have a resolution agreed upon within one week.
In the event that a resolution can't be determined in that time, the group will
respond to the reporter(s) with an update and projected timeline for resolution.</p>

<h3>Acting Unilaterally</h3>

<p>If the act is ongoing (such as someone engaging in harassment in #django), or involves
a threat to anyone's safety (e.g. threats of violence), any working group member
may act immediately (before reaching consensus) to end the situation. In ongoing
situations, any member may at their discretion employ any of the tools available
to the working group, including bans and blocks.</p>

<p>If the incident involves physical danger, any member of the working group may --
and should -- act unilaterally to protect safety. This can include contacting
law enforcement (or other local personnel) and speaking on behalf of the DSF.</p>

<p>In situations where an individual group member acts unilaterally, they must
report their actions to the working group for review within 24 hours.</p>

<h3>Resolutions</h3>

<p>The working group must agree on a resolution by consensus. If the group cannot
reach consensus and deadlocks for over a week, the group will turn the matter
over to the board for resolution.</p>

<p>Possible responses may include:
<ul>
    <li>Taking no further action (if we determine no violation occurred).</li>
    <li>A private reprimand from the working group to the individual(s) involved.
        In this case, the group chair will deliver that reprimand to the individual(s) 
        over email, cc'ing the group.</li>
    <li>A public reprimand. In this case, the group chair will deliver that reprimand 
        in the same venue that the violation occurred (i.e. in IRC for an IRC violation; 
        email for an email violation, etc.). The group may choose to publish this message 
        elsewhere for posterity.</li>
    <li>An imposed vacation (i.e. asking someone to "take a week off" from a mailing list 
        or IRC). The group chair will communicate this "vacation" to the individual(s). 
        They'll be asked to take this vacation voluntarily, but if they don't agree then 
        a temporary ban may be imposed to enforce this vacation.</li>
    <li>A permanent or temporary ban from some or all Django spaces (mailing lists, IRC, 
        etc.). The group will maintain records of all such bans so that they may be 
        reviewed in the future, extended to new Django fora, or otherwise maintained.</li>
    <li>A request for a public or private apology. The chair will deliver this request. 
        The group may, if it chooses, attach "strings" to this request: for example, 
        the group may ask a violator to apologize in order to retain his or her membership 
        on a mailing list.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Once a resolution is agreed upon, but before it is enacted, the working group
will contact the original reporter and any other affected parties and explain
the proposed resolution. The working group will ask if this resolution is
acceptable, and must note feedback for the record. However, the working group is
not required to act on this feedback.</p>

<p>Finally the working group will make a report for the DSF board (as well as the
Django core team in the event of an ongoing resolution, such as a ban).</p>

<p>The working group will never publicly discuss the issue; all public statements
will be made by the DSF board.</p>

<h3>Conflicts of Interest</h3>

<p>In the event of any conflict of interest a working group member must immediately
notify the other members, and recuse themselves if necessary.</p>

<hr>

<p><i>Editor's note: Writing this document posed a unique challenge. Most
similar guides are written on the assumption of an in-person event. However, the
Django community doesn't exist in one place, and most of the time we're spread
out across the world and interact online. This makes trying to define and
enforce community standards a different type of challenge. This document is
adapted from the <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Responding_to_reports">Ada Initiative template</a> and the <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/about/code-of-conduct/harassment-incidents/">PyCon 2013 Procedure for
Handling Harassment Incidents</a>, but changed to reflect the nature of our
community. It is our expectation that this will be a living document and change
as we grow to understand how to meet this challenge and best serve our community
and ideals.</i></p>
