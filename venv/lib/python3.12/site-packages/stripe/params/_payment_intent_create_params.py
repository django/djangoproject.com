    If you provide a Customer with the PaymentIntent, you can use this parameter to [attach the payment method](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-during-payment) to the Customer after the PaymentIntent is confirmed and the customer completes any required actions. If you don't provide a Customer, you can still [attach](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/attach) the payment method to a Customer after the transaction completes.

    If the payment method is `card_present` and isn't a digital wallet, Stripe creates and attaches a [generated_card](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-payment_method_details-card_present-generated_card) payment method representing the card to the Customer instead.

    When processing card payments, Stripe uses `setup_future_usage` to help you comply with regional legislation and network rules, such as [SCA](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication).

    If you've already set `setup_future_usage` and you're performing a request using a publishable key, you can only update the value from `on_session` to `off_session`.
