        Attaches a PaymentMethod object to a Customer.

        To attach a new PaymentMethod to a customer for future payments, we recommend you use a [SetupIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/api/setup_intents)
        or a PaymentIntent with [setup_future_usage](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-setup_future_usage).
        These approaches will perform any necessary steps to set up the PaymentMethod for future payments. Using the /v1/payment_methods/:id/attach
        endpoint without first using a SetupIntent or PaymentIntent with setup_future_usage does not optimize the PaymentMethod for
        future use, which makes later declines and payment friction more likely.
        See [Optimizing cards for future payments](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/payments/payment-intents#future-usage) for more information about setting up
        future payments.

        To use this PaymentMethod as the default for invoice or subscription payments,
        set [invoice_settings.default_payment_method](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/api/customers/update#update_customer-invoice_settings-default_payment_method),
        on the Customer to the PaymentMethod's ID.
