    A `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as
    part of Connect.

    Before April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a
    Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split
    out into a [Payout](https://stripe.com/docs/api#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more
    information, read about the
    [transfer/payout split](https://stripe.com/docs/transfer-payout-split).
