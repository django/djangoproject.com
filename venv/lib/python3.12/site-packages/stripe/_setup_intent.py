    A SetupIntent guides you through the process of setting up and saving a customer's payment credentials for future payments.
    For example, you can use a SetupIntent to set up and save your customer's card without immediately collecting a payment.
    Later, you can use [PaymentIntents](https://stripe.com/docs/api#payment_intents) to drive the payment flow.

    Create a SetupIntent when you're ready to collect your customer's payment credentials.
    Don't maintain long-lived, unconfirmed SetupIntents because they might not be valid.
    The SetupIntent transitions through multiple [statuses](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/intents#intent-statuses) as it guides
    you through the setup process.

    Successful SetupIntents result in payment credentials that are optimized for future payments.
    For example, cardholders in [certain regions](https://stripe.com/guides/strong-customer-authentication) might need to be run through
    [Strong Customer Authentication](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication) during payment method collection
    to streamline later [off-session payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/setup-intents).
    If you use the SetupIntent with a [Customer](https://stripe.com/docs/api#setup_intent_object-customer),
    it automatically attaches the resulting payment method to that Customer after successful setup.
    We recommend using SetupIntents or [setup_future_usage](https://stripe.com/docs/api#payment_intent_object-setup_future_usage) on
    PaymentIntents to save payment methods to prevent saving invalid or unoptimized payment methods.

    By using SetupIntents, you can reduce friction for your customers, even as regulations change over time.
