A Django application that provides country choices for use with forms, flag
icons static files, and a country field for models.

Country names are translated using Django's standard ``gettext``. If you would
like to help by adding a translation, please visit
https://www.transifex.com/smileychris/django-countries/


.. contents::
    :local:
    :backlinks: none


Installation
============

1. ``pip install django-countries``

   For more accurate sorting of translated country names, install it with the
   optional pyuca_ package:

   ``pip install django-countries[pyuca]``

2. Add ``django_countries`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS``

.. _pyuca: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyuca/


CountryField
============

A country field for Django models that provides all ISO 3166-1 countries as
choices.

``CountryField`` is based on Django's ``CharField``, providing choices
corresponding to the official ISO 3166-1 list of countries (with a default
``max_length`` of 2).

Consider the following model using a ``CountryField``:

.. code:: python

    from django.db import models
    from django_countries.fields import CountryField

    class Person(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
        country = CountryField()

Any ``Person`` instance will have a ``country`` attribute that you can use to
get details of the person's country:

.. code:: python

    >>> person = Person(name="Chris", country="NZ")
    >>> person.country
    Country(code='NZ')
    >>> person.country.name
    'New Zealand'
    >>> person.country.flag
    '/static/flags/nz.gif'

This object (``person.country`` in the example) is a ``Country`` instance,
which is described below.

Use ``blank_label`` to set the label for the initial blank choice shown in
forms:

.. code:: python

    country = CountryField(blank_label="(select country)")

You can filter using the full English country names in addition to country
codes, even though only the country codes are stored in the database by using
the queryset lookups ``contains``, ``startswith``, ``endswith``, ``regex``, or
their case insensitive versions. Use ``__name`` or ``__iname`` for the
``exact``/``iexact`` equivalent:

.. code:: python

    >>> Person.objects.filter(country__name="New Zealand").count()
    1
    >>> Person.objects.filter(country__icontains="zealand").count()
    1


Multi-choice
------------

This field can also allow multiple selections of countries (saved as a comma
separated string). The field will always output a list of countries in this
mode. For example:

.. code:: python

    class Incident(models.Model):
        title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
        countries = CountryField(multiple=True)

    >>> for country in Incident.objects.get(title="Pavlova dispute").countries:
    ...     print(country.name)
    Australia
    New Zealand

By default, countries are stored sorted for data consistency, and any
duplicates are removed. These behaviours can be overridden by using the field
arguments ``multiple_sort=False`` and ``multiple_unique=False`` respectively.


The ``Country`` object
----------------------

An object used to represent a country, instantiated with a two character
country code, three character code, or numeric code.

It can be compared to other objects as if it was a string containing the
country code and when evaluated as text, returns the country code.

name
  Contains the full country name.

flag
  Contains a URL to the flag. If you page could have lots of different flags
  then consider using ``flag_css`` instead to avoid excessive HTTP requests.

flag_css
  Output the css classes needed to display an HTML element as the correct flag
  from within a single sprite image that contains all flags. For example:

  .. code:: jinja

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'flags/sprite.css' %}">
    <i class="{{ country.flag_css }}"></i>

  For multiple flag resolutions, use ``sprite-hq.css`` instead and add the
  ``flag2x``, ``flag3x``, or ``flag4x`` class. For example:

  .. code:: jinja

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'flags/sprite-hq.css' %}">
    Normal: <i class="{{ country.flag_css }}"></i>
    Bigger: <i class="flag2x {{ country.flag_css }}"></i>

  You might also want to consider using ``aria-label`` for better
  accessibility:

  .. code:: jinja

    <i class="{{ country.flag_css }}"
        aria-label="{% blocktrans with country_code=country.code %}
            {{ country_code }} flag
        {% endblocktrans %}"></i>

unicode_flag
  A unicode glyph for the flag for this country. Currently well-supported in
  iOS and OS X. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Indicator_Symbol
  for details.

code
  The two letter country code for this country.

alpha3
  The three letter country code for this country.

numeric
  The numeric country code for this country (as an integer).

numeric_padded
  The numeric country code as a three character 0-padded string.

ioc_code
  The three letter International Olympic Committee country code.


``CountrySelectWidget``
-----------------------

A widget is included that can show the flag image after the select box
(updated with JavaScript when the selection changes).

When you create your form, you can use this custom widget like normal:

.. code:: python

    from django_countries.widgets import CountrySelectWidget

    class PersonForm(forms.ModelForm):
        class Meta:
            model = models.Person
            fields = ("name", "country")
            widgets = {"country": CountrySelectWidget()}

Pass a ``layout`` text argument to the widget to change the positioning of the
flag and widget. The default layout is:

.. code:: python

    '{widget}<img class="country-select-flag" id="{flag_id}" style="margin: 6px 4px 0" src="{country.flag}">'


Custom forms
============

If you want to use the countries in a custom form, use the model field's custom
form field to ensure the translatable strings for the country choices are left
lazy until the widget renders:

.. code:: python

    from django_countries.fields import CountryField

    class CustomForm(forms.Form):
        country = CountryField().formfield()

Use ``CountryField(blank=True)`` for non-required form fields, and
``CountryField(blank_label="(Select country)")`` to use a custom label for the
initial blank option.

You can also use the CountrySelectWidget_ as the widget for this field if you
want the flag image after the select box.


Get the countries from Python
=============================

Use the ``django_countries.countries`` object instance as an iterator of ISO
3166-1 country codes and names (sorted by name).

For example:

.. code:: python

    >>> from django_countries import countries
    >>> dict(countries)["NZ"]
    'New Zealand'

    >>> for code, name in list(countries)[:3]:
    ...     print(f"{name} ({code})")
    ...
    Afghanistan (AF)
    Åland Islands (AX)
    Albania (AL)


Template Tags
=============

If you have your country code stored in a different place than a
``CountryField`` you can use the template tag to get a ``Country`` object and
have access to all of its properties:

.. code:: jinja

    {% load countries %}
    {% get_country 'BR' as country %}
    {{ country.name }}

If you need a list of countries, there's also a simple tag for that:

.. code:: jinja

    {% load countries %}
    {% get_countries as countries %}
    <select>
    {% for country in countries %}
        <option value="{{ country.code }}">{{ country.name }}</option>
    {% endfor %}
    </select>


Customization
=============

Customize the country list
--------------------------

Country names are taken from the official ISO 3166-1 list, with some country
names being replaced with their more common usage (such as "Bolivia" instead
of "Bolivia, Plurinational State of").

To retain the official ISO 3166-1 naming for all fields, set the
``COUNTRIES_COMMON_NAMES`` setting to ``False``.

If your project requires the use of alternative names, the inclusion or
exclusion of specific countries then set the ``COUNTRIES_OVERRIDE`` setting to
a dictionary of names which override the defaults. The values can also use a
more `complex dictionary format`_.

Note that you will need to handle translation of customised country names.

Setting a country's name to ``None`` will exclude it from the country list.
For example:

.. code:: python

    from django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _

    COUNTRIES_OVERRIDE = {
        "NZ": _("Middle Earth"),
        "AU": None,
        "US": {
            "names": [
                _("United States of America"),
                _("America"),
            ],
        },
    }

If you have a specific list of countries that should be used, use
``COUNTRIES_ONLY``:

.. code:: python

    COUNTRIES_ONLY = ["NZ", "AU"]

or to specify your own country names, use a dictionary or two-tuple list
(string items will use the standard country name):

.. code:: python

    COUNTRIES_ONLY = [
        "US",
        "GB",
        ("NZ", _("Middle Earth")),
        ("AU", _("Desert")),
    ]


Show certain countries first
----------------------------

Provide a list of country codes as the ``COUNTRIES_FIRST`` setting and they
will be shown first in the countries list (in the order specified) before all
the alphanumerically sorted countries.

If you want to sort these initial countries too, set the
``COUNTRIES_FIRST_SORT`` setting to ``True``.

By default, these initial countries are not repeated again in the
alphanumerically sorted list. If you would like them to be repeated, set the
``COUNTRIES_FIRST_REPEAT`` setting to ``True``.

Finally, you can optionally separate these "first" countries with an empty
choice by providing the choice label as the ``COUNTRIES_FIRST_BREAK`` setting.


Customize the flag URL
----------------------

The ``COUNTRIES_FLAG_URL`` setting can be used to set the url for the flag
image assets. It defaults to:

.. code:: python

    COUNTRIES_FLAG_URL = "flags/{code}.gif"

The URL can be relative to the STATIC_URL setting, or an absolute URL.

The location is parsed using Python's string formatting and is passed the
following arguments:

* ``code``
* ``code_upper``

For example: ``COUNTRIES_FLAG_URL = "flags/16x10/{code_upper}.png"``

No checking is done to ensure that a static flag actually exists.

Alternatively, you can specify a different URL on a specific ``CountryField``:

.. code:: python

    class Person(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
        country = CountryField(
            countries_flag_url="//flags.example.com/{code}.png")


Single field customization
--------------------------

To customize an individual field, rather than rely on project level settings,
create a ``Countries`` subclass which overrides settings.

To override a setting, give the class an attribute matching the lowercased
setting without the ``COUNTRIES_`` prefix.

Then just reference this class in a field. For example, this ``CountryField``
uses a custom country list that only includes the G8 countries:

.. code:: python

    from django_countries import Countries

    class G8Countries(Countries):
        only = [
            "CA", "FR", "DE", "IT", "JP", "RU", "GB",
            ("EU", _("European Union"))
        ]

    class Vote(models.Model):
        country = CountryField(countries=G8Countries)
        approve = models.BooleanField()


Complex dictionary format
-------------------------

For ``COUNTRIES_ONLY`` and ``COUNTRIES_OVERRIDE``, you can also provide a
dictionary rather than just a translatable string for the country name.

The options within the dictionary are:

``name`` or ``names`` (required)
  Either a single translatable name for this country or a list of multiple
  translatable names. If using multiple names, the first name takes preference
  when using ``COUNTRIES_FIRST`` or the ``Country.name``.

``alpha3`` (optional)
  An ISO 3166-1 three character code (or an empty string to nullify an existing
  code for this country.

``numeric`` (optional)
  An ISO 3166-1 numeric country code (or ``None`` to nullify an existing code
  for this country. The numeric codes 900 to 999 are left available by the
  standard for user-assignment.

``ioc_code`` (optional)
  The country's International Olympic Committee code (or an empty string to
  nullify an existing code).
  

``Country`` object external plugins
-----------------------------------

Other Python packages can add attributes to the Country_ object by using entry
points in their setup script.

.. _Country: `The Country object`_

For example, you could create a ``django_countries_phone`` package which had a
with the following entry point in the ``setup.py`` file. The entry point name
(``phone``) will be the new attribute name on the Country object. The attribute
value will be the return value of the ``get_phone`` function (called with the
Country instance as the sole argument).

.. code:: python

  setup(
      ...
      entry_points={
          "django_countries.Country": "phone = django_countries_phone.get_phone"
      },
      ...
  )



Django Rest Framework
=====================

Django Countries ships with a ``CountryFieldMixin`` to make the
`CountryField`_ model field compatible with DRF serializers. Use the following
mixin with your model serializer:

.. code:: python

    from django_countries.serializers import CountryFieldMixin

    class CountrySerializer(CountryFieldMixin, serializers.ModelSerializer):

        class Meta:
            model = models.Person
            fields = ("name", "email", "country")

This mixin handles both standard and `multi-choice`_ country fields.


Django Rest Framework field
---------------------------

For lower level use (or when not dealing with model fields), you can use the
included ``CountryField`` serializer field. For example:

.. code:: python

    from django_countries.serializer_fields import CountryField

    class CountrySerializer(serializers.Serializer):
        country = CountryField()

You can optionally instantiate the field with the ``countries`` argument to
specify a custom Countries_ instance.

.. _Countries: `Single field customization`_

REST output format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, the field will output just the country code. To output the full
country name instead, instantiate the field with ``name_only=True``.

If you would rather have more verbose output, instantiate the field with
``country_dict=True``, which will result in the field having the following
output structure:

.. code:: json

    {"code": "NZ", "name": "New Zealand"}

Either the code or this dict output structure are acceptable as input
irregardless of the ``country_dict`` argument's value.


OPTIONS request
---------------

When you request OPTIONS against a resource (using the DRF `metadata support`_)
the countries will be returned in the response as choices:

.. code:: text

    OPTIONS /api/address/ HTTP/1.1

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json
    Allow: GET, POST, HEAD, OPTIONS

    {
    "actions": {
      "POST": {
        "country": {
        "type": "choice",
        "label": "Country",
        "choices": [
          {
            "display_name": "Australia",
            "value": "AU"
          },
          [...]
          {
            "display_name": "United Kingdom",
            "value": "GB"
          }
        ]
      }
    }

.. _metadata support: http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/metadata/



GraphQL
=======

A ``Country`` graphene object type is included that can be used when generating
your schema.

.. code:: python

    import graphene
    from graphene_django.types import DjangoObjectType
    from django_countries.graphql.types import Country

    class Person(ObjectType):
        country = graphene.Field(Country)

        class Meta:
            model = models.Person
            fields = ["name", "country"]

The object type has the following fields available:

* ``name`` for the full country name
* ``code`` for the ISO 3166-1 two character country code
* ``alpha3`` for the ISO 3166-1 three character country code
* ``numeric`` for the ISO 3166-1 numeric country code
* ``iocCode`` for the International Olympic Committee country code

==========
Change Log
==========

This log shows interesting changes that happen for each version, latest
versions first. It can be assumed that translations have been updated each
release, and any new translations added.

7.6.1 (2 April 2024)
====================

- Fix a TypeError when no country is selected, introduced in the Django 5 fix.


7.6 (27 March 2024)
===================

- Replace deprecated ``pkg_resources.iter_entry_points`` with
  ``importlib_metadata``.

- Support Django 5.0.

7.5.1 (1 February 2023)
=======================

- Make ``CountryField`` queryset filters also work with country codes in
  addition to names.

- Switch to ``pyproject.toml`` rather than ``setup.py`` to fix installation
  issues with pip 23.0+.


7.5 (12 December 2022)
======================

- Rename Turkey to Türkiye.

- A change in v7.4 introduced multi-choice countries being stored sorted and
  deduplicated. This remains the default behaviour going forwards, but these
  can now be overridden via arguments on the ``CountryField``.

- Improve translation fallback handling, fixing a threading race condition that
  could cause odd translation issues. Thanks to Jan Wróblewski and Antoine
  Fontaine for their help in resolving this.
  This also fixes translation issues with older Python 3.6/3.7 versions.

- Add Python 3.11, drop Python 3.6 and Django 2.2 support.


7.4.2 (10 October 2022)
=======================

- Fix error when using ``USE_I18N = False``.


7.4.1 (7 October 2022)
======================

- Fix broken translations due to last common country names fix.


7.4 (7 October 2022)
====================

- Fixed Traditional Chinese translation (needed to be ``locale/zh_Hant``).

- Update flag of Honduras.

- Add Django 4.0 and 4.1 to the test matrix, dropping 3.0 and 3.1

- Add Django Rest Framework 3.13 and 3.14, dropping 3.11.

- Multi-choice countries are now stored sorted and with duplicates stripped.
  Thanks flbraun and Jens Diemer!

- Fix common country names not being honoured in non-English translations (only
  fixed for Python 3.8+).


7.3.2 (4 March 2022)
====================

- Fix slowdown introduced in v7.3 caused by always using country name lookups
  for field comparisons. ``filter(country="New Zealand")`` will no longer match
  now, but instead new ``__name`` and ``__iname`` filters have been added to
  achieve this.


7.3.1 (1 March 2022)
====================

- Typing compatibility fixes for Python <3.9.


7.3 (28 February 2022)
======================

- Make full English country names work in database lookups, for example,
  ``Person.objects.filter(country__icontains="zealand")``.


7.2.1 (11 May 2021)
===================

- Fix Latin translations.


7.2 (10 May 2021)
=================

- Allow the character field to work with custom country codes that are not 2
  characters (such as "GB-WLS").

- Fix compatibility with ``django-migrations-ignore-attrs`` library.


7.1 (17 March 2021)
===================

- Allow customising the ``str_attr`` of Country objects returned from a
  CountryField via a new ``countries_str_attr`` keyword argument (thanks C.
  Quentin).

- Add ``pyuca`` as an extra dependency, so that it can be installed like
  ``pip install django-countries[pyuca]``.

- Add Django 3.2 support.


7.0 (5 December 2020)
=====================

- Add ``name_only`` as an option to the Django Rest Framework serializer field
  (thanks Miguel Marques).

- Add in Python typing.

- Add Python 3.9, Django 3.1, and Django Rest Framework 3.12 support.

- Drop Python 3.5 support.

- Improve IOC code functionality, allowing them to be overridden in
  ``COUNTRIES_OVERRIDE`` using the complex dictionary format.


6.1.3 (18 August 2020)
======================

- Update flag of Mauritania.

- Add flag for Kosovo (under its temporary code of XK).


6.1.2 (26 March 2020)
=====================

- Fix Python 3.5 syntax error (no f-strings just yet...).


6.1.1 (26 March 2020)
=====================

- Change ISO country import so that "Falkland Islands  [Malvinas]" => "Falkland Islands (Malvinas)".


6.1 (20 March 2020)
===================

- Add a GraphQL object type for a django ``Country`` object.


6.0 (28 February 2020)
======================

- Make DRF CountryField respect ``blank=False``. This is a backwards incompatible change since blank input will now
  return a validation error (unless ``blank`` is explicitly set to ``True``).

- Fix ``COUNTRIES_OVERRIDE`` when using the complex dictionary format and a single name.

- Add bandit to the test suite for basic security analysis.

- Drop Python 2.7 and Python 3.4 support.

- Add Rest Framework 3.10 and 3.11 to the test matrix, remove 3.8.

- Fix a memory leak when using PyUCA. Thanks Meiyer (aka interDist)!


5.5 (11 September 2019)
=======================

- Django 3.0 compatibility.

- Plugin system for extending the ``Country`` object.


5.4 (11 August 2019)
====================

- Renamed Macedonia -> North Macedonia.

- Fix an outlying ``makemigrations`` error.

- Pulled in new translations which were provided but missing from previous
  version.

- Fixed Simplified Chinese translation (needed to be ``locale/zh_Hans``).

- Introduce an optional complex format for ``COUNTRIES_ONLY`` and
  ``COUNTRIES_OVERRIDE`` to allow for multiple names for a country, a custom
  three character code, and a custom numeric country code.


5.3.3 (16 February 2019)
========================

- Add test coverage for Django Rest Framework 3.9.


5.3.2 (27 August 2018)
======================

- Tests for Django 2.1 and Django Rest Framework 3.8.


5.3.1 (12 June 2018)
====================

- Fix ``dumpdata`` and ``loaddata`` for ``CountryField(multiple=True)``.


5.3 (20 April 2018)
===================

- Iterating a ``Countries`` object now returns named tuples. This makes things
  nicer when using ``{% get_countries %}`` or using the country list elsewhere
  in your code.


5.2 (9 March 2018)
==================

- Ensure Django 2.1 compatibility for ``CountrySelectWidget``.

- Fix regression introduced into 5.1 when using Django 1.8 and certain queryset
  lookup types (like ``__in``).


5.1.1 (31 January 2018)
=======================

- Fix some translations that were included in 5.1 but not compiled.


5.1 (30 January 2018)
=====================

* Tests now also cover Django Rest Framework 3.7 and Django 2.0.

* Allow for creating country fields using (valid) alpha-3 or numeric codes.

* Fix migration error with blank default (thanks Jens Diemer).

* Add a ``{% get_countries %}`` template tag (thanks Matija Čvrk).


5.0 (10 October 2017)
=====================

* No longer allow ``multiple=True`` and ``null=True`` together. This causes
  problems saving the field, and ``null`` shouldn't really be used anyway
  because the country field is a subclass of ``CharField``.


4.6 (16 June 2017)
==================

* Add a ``CountryFieldMixin`` Django Rest Framework serializer mixin that
  automatically picks the right field type for a ``CountryField`` (both single
  and multi-choice).

* Validation for Django Rest Framework field (thanks Simon Meers).

* Allow case-insensitive ``.by_name()`` matching (thanks again, Simon).

* Ensure a multiple-choice ``CountryField.max_length`` is enough to hold all
  countries.

* Fix inefficient pickling of countries (thanks Craig de Stigter for the report
  and tests).

* Stop adding a blank choice when dealing with a multi-choice ``CountryField``.

* Tests now cover multiple Django Rest Framework versions (back to 3.3).

4.6.1
-----

* Fix invalid reStructuredText in CHANGES.

4.6.2
-----

* Use transparency layer for flag sprites.
