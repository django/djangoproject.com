# Security Policies and Procedures

This document outlines security procedures and general policies for the Django website (`djangoproject.com`) and Django documentation(`docs.djangoproject.com`). This is separate from [Django's security policies](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/security/).

## Reporting a Bug

The Django website working group is committed to responsible reporting and
disclosure of security-related issue on our website. We appreciate your efforts
and responsible disclosure.

Report security bugs and issue by creating a
[new vulnerability report](https://github.com/django/djangoproject.com/security/advisories/new)
in the djangoproject.com repository.

Once youâ€™ve submitted a security vulnerability report, the website working
group will begin their analysis. Depending on the action to be taken, you may
receive followup emails. It can take several weeks before the website working
group comes to a conclusion and resolves the issue.

## Reporting Guidelines

While reporting a security issue related to the Django website, we encourage you
to include a runnable proof of concept to reproduce the issue. That will help us
analyse the issue better.

## Comments on this Policy

If you have suggestions on how this process could be improved please create a
pull request by [editing this file](https://github.com/django/djangoproject.com/edit/main/.github/SECURITY.md).
